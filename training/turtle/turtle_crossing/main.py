    # Alternative Methods:
    # 1) We could have implemented a pause and resume feature using a different game state variable.
    # 2) Collision could have been pixel-perfect for more realism but may be computationally intensive.
    # 3) A state machine could be implemented for various game states like 'playing', 'paused', 'game_over'.
    # 4) Sounds or music could be added for more interaction.
    # 5) The level-up mechanics could be more complex, like adding more cars or introducing obstacles.
